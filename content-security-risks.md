# Content Security Risks (Overview)

## What is content security?
Content security focuses on protecting creative assets from unauthorized access, leaks, or misuse throughout the pitch-to-play lifecycle.

## Common risks
- Unauthorized access to scripts or rough cuts
- Leaks during post-production or vendor handoffs
- Over-permissioned accounts
- Human error and social engineering

## Why this matters
Leaks can damage creative intent, harm talent relationships, and undermine trust between creators and platforms. Security is not just technical — it is operational and cultural.

## What I want to learn more about

### How access controls are managed across vendors
I want to understand how access to sensitive content is granted when multiple third-party vendors are involved in production and post-production. I am curious how teams ensure vendors only have access to the specific assets they need, and how that access is reviewed or revoked once a project phase is complete.

### How risk is assessed without slowing creativity
I am interested in learning how content security teams evaluate risk in fast-moving creative environments without disrupting production workflows. I want to better understand how security decisions are made in a way that protects content while still allowing creative teams to work efficiently.

### How physical and digital security overlap in production environments
I want to learn how physical security measures, such as controlled access to sets or equipment, complement digital protections like account permissions and secure file sharing. Understanding how these areas work together would help me see how content is protected across its entire lifecycle.
