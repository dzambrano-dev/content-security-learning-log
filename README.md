# Content Security Learning Log

## Purpose
I am intrested in content security at the intersection of technology, risk mangment, and creative production. This repository will serve as a learning log where I may document, concepts, risk, and workflows related to protecting digital content across its lifecycle.

## What I will be learing
- How security risks emerge during, pre-production, production, and post-production.
- The role of access control, trust and confidentiality in creative enviroments.
- How technical and non-technical teams collaborate to reduce risk
- Why content leaks impact creators, talent, and buissness outcomes.

## Background
I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate with an intrest in cybersecurity and systems thinking. I am motivated to understand how security principlesapply beyond traditional IT eniormnets and into real-world creative piplines.

## How this repository will be used
This repository contains shot notes and reflections on content security topics as I learn them. To emphasize clarity of thought, risk awareness, and practical understanding over  polished tooling.
